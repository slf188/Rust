# The Rust Programming Language

High-level ergonomics and low-level control are often at odds in programming language design; Rust challenges that conflict. Rust gives you the option to control low-level details (such as memory usage) without all the hassle traditionally associated with such control.

### Who is Rust for

**Team of developers**

In Rust, the compiler plays a gatekeeper role by refusing to compile code with these elusive bugs, including concurrency bugs. By working alongside the compiler, the team can spend their time focusing on the program’s logic rather than chasing down bugs.

Rust also brings developer tools like:

- Cargo, the included dependency manager and build tool, makes adding, compiling, and managing dependencies painless and consistent across the Rust ecosystem.
- Rustfmt ensures a consistent coding style across developers.
- Rust Language Server, a server that provides in a background, providing IDEs, editors and other tools about Rust programs.

By using these tools in the Rust ecosystem, developers can be productive while writting systems-level code.

**Students**

Rust is for students and those who are interested in learning about systems concepts. Using Rust, many people have learned about topics like operating systems development.

**Open Source**

Rust is for people who want to build the Rust programming language, community, developer tools, and libraries.

### How to use the book

Later chapters build on concepts in earlier chapters.

You’ll find two kinds of chapters in this book: concept chapters and project chapters. Chapters 2, 12, and 20 are project chapters; the rest are concept chapters.

Here is a quick review of what will be reviewed in the 20 chapters:
