# The Rust Programming Language
In this repo I will review some of the most important concepts about the Rust Programming Language.

The Rust Programming Language introduces and explains how rust can be used to develop software in a daily basis. It contains basic information about the cargo dependency manager and many other concepts too.

## Installation
To download and install rust on macOS or Linux, run the following command in your terminal:
```zh
$ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```
If the install is successful, the following line will appear:
```zh
Rust is installed now. Great!
```

## Running a Rust program
On Linux or macOS, enter the following commands to compile and run the file:
```zh
$ rustc main.rs
$ ./main
Hello, world!
```
